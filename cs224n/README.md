## README

This repository contains my implementation of labs of both cs224N(stanford winter 2021) and Shu introduction to nlp.  
nlp tasks have some difference between Chinese and English. For instance, Chinese usually needs word segmentation while english is segmented naturally. But their methods or the way of considering these tasks may be general.
