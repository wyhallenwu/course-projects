# Cryptography
This repository is of course "Cryptography" conducted by prof.Jiangtao Li.  
Both course labs and my practice are available in this repository. Owing to time constraints, some readmes 
are concise and may not cover the principles. But you can catch the main idea in codes. 
### Prerequisite
I use pipenv to manage python environment.  
```bash
$ pipenv install  --dev
$ pipenv shell
```
