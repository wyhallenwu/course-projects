# Readme

This project is about course "operating system(2)" at Shanghai University.  My recommendation is MIT 6.s801 operating system engineer. The website is https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2021/.

Also I strongly recommend you trying the project attached to the MIT course -- XV6.

All codes are written through VScode.


I try not to use STL in this project, because I haven't write basic data structure for a long time. It's a good to help me review these techniques.
